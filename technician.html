                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
                    Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                    its environment to provide programmatic control over them. </p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
                    elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.</p>
                <p>Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                        For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond
                        to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.
                        For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity
                        of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</p></li>
                    <li><p>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</p></li>
                    <li><p>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</p></li>
                </ul>

            <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_and_Java">
                <header><h1>JavaScript and Java</h1></header>

                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. </p>
                <p>The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.</p>
                <p>JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based
                    on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.</p>
                <p>JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
                    provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.</p>
                <p>JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
                <header><h1>Hello world</h1></header>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                    greetMe("World");</code>
                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
                <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
                <code>var x = 42.</code>
                <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
                <code>x = 42.</code>
                <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
                <code>let y = 13.</code>
                <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
                    function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the
                    scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
                <header><h1>Global variables</h1></header>

                <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.
                    variable syntax.</p>
                <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name.
                    For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
                <header><h1>Constants</h1></header>

                <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier:
                    it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>
                <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
                <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
                <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
                    WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
                    //statements }</code>
                <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
                <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
                    "otherValue";</code>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
                <header><h1>Data types</h1></header>

                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Six data types that are primitives:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                            <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                            <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>and Object.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with
                    your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language.
                    You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.
